# SFTP Platform  Infrastructure as Code

## SFTP Platform Data Engineering Platform
SFTP Platform infrastructure consists of the following Azure Services:
* SQL Server and Databases

## Bicep
This codebase uses Bicep as the Azure ARM Template generating machanism. This allows the code to be as modular as possible and work well with the Azure Resource Manager.
